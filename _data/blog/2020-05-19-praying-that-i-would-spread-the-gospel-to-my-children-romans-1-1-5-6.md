As we think about the life that lies ahead for our children, we find ourselves wanting them to have a perfect life, free from failures and disappointments. We want them to*be*someone. To have successful careers. To be influential and likable. To be safe, happy, healthy. To be financially secure and happily married.

So we try to map out the "perfect life" for them.

We play “My Baby Can Read” videos to them when they can barely babble, in hopes they would excel.

We move to the best school zones. (UGH… moving…)

We take on extra jobs so they could have extracurricular activities.

We gently encourage their dreams.

We “pull strings” at work to help them get a foot in the door at a corporate job. Or bring them alongside the family business.

WE WANT THEM TO SUCCEED. Any good parent would agree.

But in the midst of these noble acts, we must ask… are we putting in the same effort to teach our children about God? the gospel? Their eternal destinations? Their sinful nature? God’s amazing grace?

If we are not pouring our lives into our children to make them lovers of God, we are missing the very purpose of our parenthood.

#### **Your #1 Parenting Goal should be to…**

…cultivate an obedient heart and life that comes from knowing we are accepted and righteous in God’s eyes through our faith in Jesus Christ.

That was Paul’s mission in life. In Romans 1:5, he shares that his goal in life is to “bring about among the gentiles…the obedience that comes from faith.” He wants to see the gentiles place their faith in Christ and know they are accepted, and he wants to see the obedience that comes from that faith.

He is “set apart for the gospel” (Romans 1:1), meaning that he has moved away from everyone else to pursue this one mission of spreading this good news. Are you?

*Is this your life mission? To see your children obey God out of a heart of faith?*

*Like Paul, are you willing to give up everything to see this accomplished?*

## Prayer

> Heavenly Father, you are gracious. You have accepted me into your family, through the death of your beloved Son, Jesus.
>
> And now, I pray that my child would be part of this amazing family.
>
> Help me to pour my life into this one goal- to share the gospel with my child so that they would be part of this family too. I want so many good things for them - health, stability, success. But help me see that what they need above all, is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
>
> I ask that you would bless my efforts, and open the ears of my child so that they would receive that good news and trust in you.
>
> Thank you for “setting me apart” for this mission.
>
> In the saving name of your Son, Jesus Christ, amen.
